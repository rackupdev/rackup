@rackupdev helps developers simplify building and running cloud based apps

## What does the platform do? ##
TLDR: Rackup allows you to define and deploy backend APIs through config files.  It's primarily intended for people that have at least some basic web development skills
but who do not know how (or like) to deal with infrastructure, databases, SQL queries, build/deployment pipelines, and all the typical application headaches such as
authentication, authorization, security, scalability, robustness, versioning, backups, etc...

### Dogfooding ###
We're just getting started so many features are still on our backlog, but we hope that what's already built will be of use to you.  You may
be interested in knowing that we eat our own dogfood... the platform itself is built ontop of the Rackup Kernel! 😲  You should also be aware
that the platform is intentially designed to be highly ~~biased~~ opinionated, based on our collective experiences about what has worked well building
web-based applications.

## Getting started ##
- 🏗️ create an account at [rackup.dev](https://rackup.dev) (**important**: the email address you use to register must match your Github email address)
- 👀 verify the email address by following the instructions in the mail you'll receive
- 🍴fork our [sample app repo](rackup_sample_app), or create your own repo from scratch (see our [documentation](https://docs.rackup.dev))
- 🧰 install our [Rackup Github App](https://...) (handles automated deployments to our infrastructure)
- :shipit: push to your `main` branch
- 🏁 go back to [rackup.dev](https://rackup.dev) to see access and control your new app


## Your feedback matters, more than you think! ##
💬 🙊 We wanted to get the platform out sooner rather than later, and refine it based on _your_ feedback.  While we do strive for a reasonable
level of quality for what we release, the platform is still early-stage and so are the first to admit that it's definitely still only has a
small [quantum of utility](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=542768) but still hopefully useful to _someone_.

Nonetheless, we'd love to hear what you think and invite you to suggest new features you'd like to see built
(we can't promise anything, but it certainly doesn't hurt to ask).  Please keep in mind that while we probably need hear about things
you believe are broken or could be improved, we also get fired up hearing about things you _enjoy_ about the product.
